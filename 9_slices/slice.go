package main

// slice -> a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array.
// most used data structure/construct in Go.
// slices are more powerful than arrays, as they can grow and shrink in size.
// + most useful operations/methods on slices are built into the language (Go).
// + slices are reference types, meaning they point to an underlying array.
// + slices can be created using the built-in `make` function or by slicing an array.
// + slices have a length and a capacity. The length is the number of elements in the slice, and the capacity is the number of elements in the underlying array that can be accessed without reallocating memory.
